## 🎵 Concert Circle — The Ultimate Live Music & Gig Platform 🎤

**Concert Circle** is a dynamic and interactive web platform that connects **artists, fans, and event organizers** in one musical ecosystem. Whether you're an artist looking to perform, an organizer planning a gig, or a fan wanting to book tickets, this platform offers **everything in one place**.

Users can **discover concerts**, explore **artist lineups**, and **apply for gigs** through custom forms. Event organizers can list festivals and manage submissions. All data — including gigs, concerts, and user actions — is **securely stored in MongoDB Atlas** on the cloud.

* 📋 Apply for gigs via interactive forms
* 🗓️ Browse upcoming schedules & festivals
* 📊 Organizer-friendly dashboard experience
* 📡 Live streaming and virtual concert access

### ⚙️ Tech Stack:

### 🌐 Project Flow:

1. 🎬 Homepage introduces the Concert Circle brand
2. 🎟️ Users can explore concerts and artists

4. 🧠 Data is saved in **MongoDB Atlas** for admin review
5. 📺 Optional live streaming & concert event view features

### 📌 Why It Stands Out:

* **Complete ecosystem** for concert discovery and management
* **Cloud-powered scalability** using MongoDB Atlas
* **Modern UI/UX** with stunning visuals and animations
* **Interactive gig planning** for artists and organizers
* **Custom 3D & scroll effects** for immersive experience
